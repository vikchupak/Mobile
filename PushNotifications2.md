# How push notifications are hadled in famous apps

Great question. Here's how **famous apps like WhatsApp, Instagram, and Gmail** generally handle **push notification permissions** ‚Äî especially when multiple users may use the same app on one device:

## üì± Big Apps Notification Permission Patterns

| App           | When it asks for permission     | Per-user handling? | Re-prompts? | User clarity?                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| **WhatsApp**  | After phone number verification | üîí Yes             | ‚ùå No        | ‚úÖ Pre-prompt dialog              |
| **Instagram** | After login, during onboarding  | üîí Yes             | ‚ùå No        | ‚úÖ Shows custom screen            |
| **Gmail**     | After account added / synced    | üîí Yes             | ‚ùå No        | ‚úÖ Offers granular controls       |
| **Facebook**  | After login, with optional skip | üîí Yes             | ‚ùå No        | ‚úÖ Explains benefit before prompt |

## üîç What They Have in Common

### 1. **Delayed Request**

* They **do not ask for notification permissions on app start.**
* Instead, they wait until the user is **logged in and engaged**, e.g., during onboarding.

### 2. **Pre-Permission Dialog**

* They usually **show a custom screen first** explaining:

  > "Turn on notifications to stay updated on messages and activity."

* Then they show the OS popup.

This increases the chance of the user tapping ‚ÄúAllow‚Äù.

### 3. **Per-User Tracking (Implicit)**

* Even though OS permissions are device-level, they track internally which user has been prompted already and **avoid asking again**.
* They handle **multi-account support** (e.g., Instagram lets you switch accounts) without re-prompting every time.

### 4. **No Re-prompting if Denied**

* If you deny notification access once, they don‚Äôt keep prompting.
* Instead, they show a passive banner like:

  > ‚ÄúTurn on notifications in Settings for full experience.‚Äù

## ‚úÖ Best Practice Summary (Like Famous Apps)

| Best Practice                  | How You Can Implement It in Flutter              |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Ask after login/onboarding     | `requestPermission()` after login screen         |
| Show pre-permission dialog     | Use a custom `AlertDialog` before OS prompt      |
| Track per-user prompts         | Store `asked_permission_for_$userId` in prefs    |
| Don't show prompt if denied    | Use `getNotificationSettings()` to detect denial |
| Support multiple users/devices | Track FCM tokens per user in Firestore           |

# **Pre-Permission Dialog**: So the user is asked twice, on the custom screen and later on OS popup?

Yes, exactly ‚Äî **that‚Äôs intentional and considered best UX practice**.

---

### ‚úÖ What is a Pre-Permission Dialog?

A **custom in-app dialog/screen** shown *before* calling the OS-level permission request.
Its goal is to:

* Explain **why** the app wants permission
* Reduce the chance that the user taps "Don't Allow"
* Let the app **delay** or **skip** OS popup for now, based on user choice

---

### ‚úÖ Why ask twice?

| Prompt Type    | Who shows it?      | Can be skipped?  | Customizable? |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Pre-permission | Your app           | ‚úÖ Yes            | ‚úÖ Yes         |
| OS popup       | Android/iOS system | ‚ùå No (if called) | ‚ùå No          |

You **ask once in your own words**, and if user agrees, then you call:

```dart
await FirebaseMessaging.instance.requestPermission();
```

Only then does the **OS popup** appear.

---

### ‚úÖ Real-world example flow:

1. **App dialog:**
   *"We‚Äôd love to send you updates about your orders and messages."*
   üëâ Buttons: `Allow` / `Maybe Later`

2. **If user taps "Allow" ‚Üí**
   Call `requestPermission()` ‚Üí OS popup shows

3. **If user taps "Maybe Later" ‚Üí**
   Do nothing ‚Äî don‚Äôt call the OS prompt yet

---

### ‚úÖ Benefits:

* Users are more likely to grant permissions if they understand why
* You can retry or delay the prompt without getting locked out
* If the user taps "Don't Allow" on the OS popup, **you can‚Äôt ask again unless they manually change it in Settings**
