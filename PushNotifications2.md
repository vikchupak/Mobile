## üì± Big Apps Notification Permission Patterns

| App           | When it asks for permission     | Per-user handling? | Re-prompts? | User clarity?                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| **WhatsApp**  | After phone number verification | üîí Yes             | ‚ùå No        | ‚úÖ Pre-prompt dialog              |
| **Instagram** | After login, during onboarding  | üîí Yes             | ‚ùå No        | ‚úÖ Shows custom screen            |
| **Gmail**     | After account added / synced    | üîí Yes             | ‚ùå No        | ‚úÖ Offers granular controls       |
| **Facebook**  | After login, with optional skip | üîí Yes             | ‚ùå No        | ‚úÖ Explains benefit before prompt |

## üîç What They Have in Common

### 1. **Delayed Request**

* They **do not ask for notification permissions on app start.**
* Instead, they wait until the user is **logged in and engaged**, e.g., during onboarding.

### 2. **Pre-Permission Dialog**

* They usually **show a custom screen first** explaining:

  > "Turn on notifications to stay updated on messages and activity."

* Then they show the OS popup.

This increases the chance of the user tapping ‚ÄúAllow‚Äù.

### 3. **Per-User Tracking (Implicit)**

* Even though OS permissions are device-level, they track internally which user has been prompted already and **avoid asking again**.
* They handle **multi-account support** (e.g., Instagram lets you switch accounts) without re-prompting every time.

### 4. **No Re-prompting if Denied**

* If you deny notification access once, they don‚Äôt keep prompting.
* Instead, they show a passive banner like:

  > ‚ÄúTurn on notifications in Settings for full experience.‚Äù
