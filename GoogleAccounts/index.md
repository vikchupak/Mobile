- (Regular) Google Account → identity.

**1. Regular Google Account**

* What most people have (e.g., `you@gmail.com`).
* Gives access to Gmail, Google Drive, YouTube, Photos, etc.
* Free to create.
* Can be personal or part of **Google Workspace** (business email like `you@company.com`).
* **Not** automatically able to publish apps — it’s just your identity in Google’s ecosystem.

**2. Google Play Developer Account**

* This is an *upgrade* (in a sense) for a Google account so it can publish apps.
* You take your regular Google account → pay **\$25 USD one-time fee** → fill in developer details → it becomes a **Developer Account**.
* Lets you access **Google Play Console**.
* Linked to *exactly one* Google account — you can’t switch the account later.

---

**3. Google Play Console**

* The web dashboard for developers:

  * Upload APK/AAB files.
  * Configure app listings, screenshots, and descriptions.
  * Manage in-app purchases, subscriptions, testers.
  * Track installs, crashes, reviews.
* Think of it like the “control room” for your apps.
