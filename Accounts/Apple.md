**1. Regular Apple ID**

* What most people have (e.g., `you@icloud.com`).
* Gives access to iCloud, Apple Mail, App Store (as a customer), Apple Music, etc.
* Free to create.
* Can be personal or linked to an organization (Apple Business Manager / Apple School Manager).
* **Not** automatically able to publish apps — it’s just your identity in Apple’s ecosystem.

**2. Apple Developer Program Account**

* This is the *upgrade* for an Apple ID so it can publish apps on the App Store.
* You take your regular Apple ID → enroll in the **Apple Developer Program** → pay **\$99 USD/year** → verify identity (individual or organization).
* Lets you access **App Store Connect**, developer tools, and beta testing via TestFlight.
* Linked to exactly one Apple ID — you can’t transfer it to another Apple ID without Apple’s approval.
* Two main enrollment types:

  * **Individual** — publishes under your personal name.
  * **Organization** — publishes under your company name (requires D-U-N-S number).

**3. App Store Connect**
The web dashboard for developers (similar to Google Play Console):

* Upload IPA builds (via Xcode, Transporter, or API).
* Configure app listings, screenshots, and descriptions.
* Manage in-app purchases, subscriptions, and TestFlight beta testers.
* Track downloads, sales, crashes, and reviews.
* Think of it as the **control center** for your iOS/macOS apps.
